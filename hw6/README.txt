Homework 6

I used the tutorial at http://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/index.html as the starting point for this assignment.
Upgrades:
Uses buffer indexing instead of raw buffers.
Uses touch input to control view matrix.
Added a cube.
Added lighting.

I spent roughly 15 hours on this assignment.

This was tested on Lollipop (Android 5.1).
