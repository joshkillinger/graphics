Homework 6

I had not created an Android app before this assignment. I took several tutorials before getting started.
I used the tutorial at http://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/index.html as the starting point for this assignment.
Upgrades:
Uses buffer indexing instead of raw buffers.
Uses touch input to control view matrix.
Fixed issue with X axis being inverted.
Added a cube.
Added lighting.
Added a texture to the cube.

I spent roughly 15 hours on this assignment.

Built with gradle-2.8.
I'm not sure what the command line operations to build it are, as I used Android Studio, but gradle config files are included.
This was tested on Lollipop (Android 5.1).
