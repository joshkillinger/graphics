Final Project Proposal

I plan to implement the following features:

There will be an object in the scene which has an invisible "shield." When struck, this shield will become visible at the struck point,
and this will generate a ripple effect radiating outwards for a short time. This will be done in a shader by calculating the alpha value
of a texture on a sphere around the object based on the hit point. This will require learning how to do alpha blending, which is something
I have not done in OpenGL, and will require additional investigation.

I will also have a method of providing input to determine whether the shield has been hit or not. This will likely involve a ray-trace based
on a click input. I have also never done any raytracing with OpenGL, although I have done it in C++ before. The result of the ray-trace would
be used as input to the shader for the shield. I may not use ray-tracing, I may use projectile collision detection. This is TBD.

Then I will add a particle system that would follow the traced ray, giving visual indication of where the projectile or laser is being fired.
Billboarding will likely be the implementation used, but it depends on the actual effect that I decide to create. The same goes for CPU or GPU
calculations for the particles.

Finally, if time allows, I will turn this into a mini-game. There would be a small arena, the player could move around the arena, and there would
be a hitpoint system. When the shield is exhausted, the shield would not show up, and the enemy would be damaged instead. I believe this would be
a significant endeavor, and I would likely only end up with a partial implementation of this.
