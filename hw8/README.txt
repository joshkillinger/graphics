Homework 8

I started by creating a quad object and applying a normal map to it. I simplified this task by requiring that the quad be axis aligned with the normal (0,1,0) and tangent (1,0,0).

I found a sample normal map (hexes) here: https://www.filterforge.com/filters/6624-normal.jpg
Perlin noise class is based on http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Perlin_Noise_Class.shtml

I spent roughly _ hours on this assignment.

This was tested on Windows 7 x64 using MingW 4.9.2 for CMake, and Qt 5.2.1 MSVC2010 32bit OpenGL.
