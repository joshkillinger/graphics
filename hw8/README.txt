Homework 8

I started by creating a quad object and applying a normal map to it.

I found a sample normal map (hexes) here: https://www.filterforge.com/filters/6624-normal.jpg

I spent roughly _ hours on this assignment.

This was tested on Windows 7 x64 using MingW 4.9.2 for CMake, and Qt 5.2.1 MSVC2010 32bit OpenGL.
